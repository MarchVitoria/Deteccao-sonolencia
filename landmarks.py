#   This example program shows how to use dlib's implementation of the paper:
#   One Millisecond Face Alignment with an Ensemble of Regression Trees by
#   Vahid Kazemi and Josephine Sullivan, CVPR 2014
#
#   In particular, we will train a face landmarking model based on a small
#   dataset and then evaluate it.  If you want to visualize the output of the
#   trained model on some images then you can run the
#   face_landmark_detection.py example program with predictor.dat as the input
#   model.
#
#   It should also be noted that this kind of model, while often used for face
#   landmarking, is quite general and can be used for a variety of shape
#   prediction tasks.  But here we demonstrate it only on a simple face
#   landmarking task.

# In this example we are going to train a face detector based on the small

# the path to this faces folder as a command line argument so we will know
# where it is.

# This algorithm has a bunch of parameters you can mess with.  The
# documentation for the shape_predictor_trainer explains all of them.
# You should also read Kazemi's paper which explains all the parameters
# in great detail.  However, here I'm just setting three of them
# differently than their default values.  I'm doing this because we
# have a very small dataset.  In particular, setting the oversampling
# to a high amount (300) effectively boosts the training set size, so
# that helps this example.

# the regularization (making nu smaller) and by using trees with

# measures the average distance between a face landmark output by the
# shape_predictor and where it should be according to the truth data.

# it's still doing quite good.  Moreover, if you train it on one of the large
# face landmarking datasets you will obtain state-of-the-art results, as shown
# in the Kazemi paper.
